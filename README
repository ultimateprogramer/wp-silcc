WP-SILCC v1.6
==============

WP-SiLCC auto-generates tags for blog content.  It uses a natural language processing API called OpenSiLCC (http://opensilcc.com) from Swiftly.org.  WP-SiLCC differs from similar auto-tagging plugins because it utilizes active learning techniques to improve it's tagging ability over time.
